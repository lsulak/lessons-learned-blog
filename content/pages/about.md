Hi, my name is Ladislav Sulak, I currently live in a magical city in the heart of Europe, Prague.

I build software. Welcome to my blog!

I started this site as a way to capture and share my journey in tech.

What can you find here?

* The vast majority of the content is about <u>software engineering with some intersection
  of data science.</u>

* I like to share my experiences and thoughts on various aspects of software development lifecycle
  that go beyond a pure coding. Interesting concepts and philosophies. Software design and architecture.
  Stakeholder engagement, agile project management and leadership. Anything that I consider worth sharing
  and is part of the game.

* Blog posts related to my occasional participation in various hackathons and online challenges,
  or just quick highlights from conferences I watch, books I read, or certifications I undertake.


## Why Do I Blog?

* LEARN. When I learn something new, I like to think about it, reiterate, and ideally compact
  the most important lessons into a nice format, resulting in a blog post. This way my learning
  experience is even more reinforced.

* STORE. I don't have good enough memory for remembering everything I learn/experience for extended period of time.
  Each blog post is a tiny piece of my brain dump which I can easily find and refer to later.

* SHARE. I am very transparent person who loves to share. Perhaps other people will find my posts useful.
