Hi! My name is Ladislav Sulak, I currently live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;magical city in the heart of Europe,
Prague...and I build software.

I started this site as a&nbsp;way to capture and share my journey in tech. Welcome to my blog!

What can you find here?

* A vast majority of the content is about <u>software engineering with some intersection of&nbsp;data science.</u>

* Experiences, thoughts, or just my notes related to various aspects of the software development lifecycle
  that go beyond pure coding. Interesting concepts and philosophies. Software design and architecture.
  Stakeholder engagement, agile project management and leadership. Anything that I&nbsp;consider interesting
  and is part of&nbsp;the game.

* Blog posts related to my occasional participation in hackathons and online challenges,
  or just quick highlights from conferences I&nbsp;watch, books I&nbsp;read, or&nbsp;certifications I&nbsp;undertake.

## Why Do I Blog?

* <u>To learn.</u> When I learn something new, I like to take a moment and think about it, reiterate, and ideally compact
  the most important lessons into a&nbsp;nice format, resulting in a&nbsp;blog post. This way my learning
  experience is even more reinforced.

* <u>To store.</u> I don't have good enough memory to remember everything I&nbsp;learn/experience for
  extended period of time. Each blog post is a&nbsp;tiny piece of my brain dump, which I&nbsp;can easily
  find and refer to later.

* <u>To share.</u> I'm a very transparent person, who loves to share. Perhaps other people will find my posts useful.
