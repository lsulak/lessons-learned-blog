# lessons-learned-blog

My personal blog about various things I learned, and I'm continuously
learning, in tech. I focus on software engineering with some intersection
of data science.

Keywords could be (at least at the time of writing) around: software engineering,
data engineering, data science, SDLC, Python, bash, databases, cloud, Linux.
